# TODO
- Add option to delete all shopping lists and option to delete all product lists in a shopping list
- Add option to encrypt shoppinglist / products names and descriptions in the DB
- Add eslint to node backend
- Add side menu, add possibility to create new lists on the menu, logout and other stuff
- Prevent load pages if not authenticated
- Add Appcenter page to list all user apps (right now, list everything. In the future allow user to choose apps to show)
- Add redux
- **Important:** Start developing another app, we need to manage and track tasks/ticket. Something like Obsidian/Trello. We need reminders and nagging stuff on this

# Tips
- Use Frontend/Backend readme for app instructions, use this file for todos and generic stuff
